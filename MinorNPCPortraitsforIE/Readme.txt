# MinorNPCPortraitsforBGEE
This mod adds small portraits to speaking NPCs in BG:EE including the Siege of Dragonspear expansion.  
The big world of Baldur's Gate gets even more beautiful!  The goal of this mod is to add small portraits 
to nearly all speaking NPC in the game.

If any of the portraits are not to your satisfaction due to quality or you feel that the portrait does not
match the in game NPC, feel free to post on the forums for potential inclusion in future updates.  Future updates from Beamdog may 
require reinstallation of the mod.  If there is an update to the game, it's a good idea to reinstall this mod.
Keep in mind that when installing or reinstalling this mod, NPCs on areas you've previously visited won't get portraits, 
but areas and NPCs you haven't yet visited will.  If you restart the game, then all NPCs that should get portraits will get them.

The "NPCs without Portraits Get Random Portraits" component assigns portraits from a pool of random portraits to humans that speak and are 
not children that do not already have portraits.  This will lead to repetition of portraits in game. These random portraits should only 
affect people with very little to say. These should be only for the minorest of MINOR MINOR NPCs.  If you install this component after 
installing other mods that add NPCs (for example a large quest mod) then NPCs from that mod should also get random portraits if their 
portraits are not specified. 

Sources of the pictures include Neverwinter Nights portraits found online, searches for baldur's gate and IWD portraits,
The Super Ultimate Portrait Pack (http://www.moddb.com/games/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/addons/super-ultimate-portrait-pack),
 and as a last resort I used search engines to round out the collection.   
 
Baldur's Gate prior to the EE editions had mods that included small portraits for some NPCs.   The pictures in these mods are lower 
resolution than the ones carefully selected for this mod.  Some of these older mods for classic Baldur's Gate with smaller pictures 
that directly inspired this project are:
Gerri's BGT NPC Portraits ( https://kerzenburg.baldurs-gate.eu/downloads.php?id=69 )
BG1NPC ( http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg1npc/ )

If there are any particular portraits that need to be removed you don't wish them to be featured in this work, 
let me know and the pictures will be removed. If you have any suggestions for submissions or changes, please feel free to comment 
in the discussion forum.

or endorsed by BioWare, Interplay/Black Isle, Beamdog or any other official agency. Portraits remain the copyright of 
their respective rights holders.  

If there are any copyright issues or this statement needs revision then please contact me to let me know what to do 
about it.  The purpose of this mod is not to make money but to advances knowledge and progress of the arts through 
the addition of something new onto a great game. 

Special thanks to bob_veng on the baldur's gate.com forums for assistance recoloring, adjusting, selecting and creating new portraits 
for this mod.

Thank you all and enjoy,
Smeagol
